### Description
Recreation of the Bowman and Perry (2017) model of forest-savanna transitions in R.

### Results (example)

With the model conditions of the `Edaphic boundary` and `Fire-Soil feedback` toggled on, the model produces the following state transition dynamics:

### Usage
The `run_simulation` function within the script allows for "turning on/off" the *Edaphic boundary* and *Fire-Soil feedback* conditions, along with on-the-fly plotting of the state transition dynamics.
